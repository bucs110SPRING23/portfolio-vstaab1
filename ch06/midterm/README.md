# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
# My program is a turtle-based program that takes three variables (spikiness, revolutions, and scale) to produce a spirograph of the users' specifications.
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
# NONE
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
# https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14713037/python-turtle-set-start-position
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
# Turtle will be invisible until variables are given and the drawing begins.
# Size is relative to spikiness. Size 1 for a graph with spikiness 43 will have a different diameter than a size 1 graph with spikiness 65.
# One of the instructions states "Unless functionally required not to, by default, function parameters should be named with default values." I gave my arguments names after the variables they are using because I kept getting confused while using non-named arguments.
